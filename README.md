# VacMeBot
This Python script searches periodically for the next free appointment on VacMe Bern/ZÃ¼rich \
The data is fetched from this website: https://boostli.web.app/ \
If a free appointment within a given threshold date has been found, the script sends a telegram message to the user. \
This allows reacting quickly and make a reservation as soon as possible.
